A new Kubernetes vulnerability, [CVE-2024-7646](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7646), has recently been identified and demands urgent attention from security professionals and DevOps teams. This vulnerability severely threatens the security of systems using the widely adopted ingress-nginx controller, potentially allowing attackers to bypass annotation validation and gain unauthorized access to critical cluster resources.

To resolve the CVE-2024-7646 vulnerability in Kubernetes environments using ingress-nginx, it’s critical to take immediate steps:

1. Upgrade Ingress-NGINX: The most effective measure is to upgrade ingress-nginx to version 1.11.2 or higher. This version contains the necessary security patches to mitigate the vulnerability, preventing attackers from exploiting the annotation validation bypass.
1. Restrict Annotations: Explicitly disallow the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet annotation to further safeguard your system. This step ensures that no unauthorized or potentially malicious configurations can be injected.
1. Enforce TLS Client Verification: Set the auth-tls-verify-client annotation to either ‘on,’ ‘off,’ ‘optional,’ or ‘optional_no_ca’ values. This enforces stricter control over TLS client authentication, reducing the attack surface by ensuring that only correctly authenticated clients can interact with your services.
