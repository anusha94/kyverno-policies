      ClamAV antivirus software can be used to scan for viruses and malware in Kubernetes clusters.
      ClamAV is commonly used in Kubernetes environments to protect against threats that could
      potentially harm containers or the entire cluster.
      This policy ensures that all containers in a Pod use the ClamAV antivirus.
