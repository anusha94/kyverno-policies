      Annotations are key/value pairs, which is used as an important source of metadata describing
      objects in various ways or triggering other functionality. Annotations are also a very basic
      concept and should be used throughout Kubernetes. This policy performs a simple mutation
      which adds a Annotation `foo=bar` to Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.
